Then God said, “Let lights appear in the sky to separate the day from the night. Let them be signs to mark the seasons, days, and years.
Let these lights in the sky shine down on the earth.” And that is what happened.
God made two great lights—the larger one to govern the day, and the smaller one to govern the night. He also made the stars.
God set these lights in the sky to light the earth,to govern the day and night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
And evening passed and morning came, marking the fourth day.
